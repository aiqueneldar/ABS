ABS
===

ABS (Auto Beer System) should in reality be called ABDS (Auto Beer Distribution System) as it tracks who has contributed to with stocks of beer and who has participated in the drinking of the beer. This project began as a hobby for me and my roommates in our university collective apartment. As more people wanted to use it I am now rewriting it and publishing it public for all to enjoy. There is probably more advanced and better systems out there. This is made in my spare time for my enjoyment.
